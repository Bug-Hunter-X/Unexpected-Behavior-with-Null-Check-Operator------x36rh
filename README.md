# Dart Null Check Operator Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Dart's null check operator (`??`) when used with nullable types (`int?`). In scenarios where the variable isn't truly null, but the null check yields an unexpected result, this example shows the problem and provides a solution.

The `bug.dart` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.dart` offers a corrected version.  The issue stems from potential type mismatches or unanticipated circumstances leading to incorrect null evaluation.
